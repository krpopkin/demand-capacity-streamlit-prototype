## Overview

DC (Demand-Capacity) helps you:

- **Reports**  
  1. View demand per product by role  
  2. View capacity (allocations) per team member across products  

- **Demand**  
  - **Products** tab ‚Äì manage product name, product manager, and executive sponsor  
  - **Assignments** tab ‚Äì assign team members to products with allocation %  

- **Capacity**  
  - **Roles** tab ‚Äì define portfolio roles  
  - **Team Members** tab ‚Äì list team members  
  - **Skills Matrix** tab ‚Äì designate team-member skill level (beginner, intermediate, expert) for each role

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

- **Python** 3.x  
- **PostgreSQL** database (hosted on GCP)  
- **Docker** (for deployment to Cloud Run)

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of `requirements.txt`:

```
streamlit
pandas
sqlalchemy
psycopg2-binary
streamlit-aggrid
xlsxwriter
```

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/dc.git
   cd dc
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your database credentials**  
   - Edit `db.py` and replace the dummy values with your actual `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_NAME`.  
   - **Do not commit real credentials!**

4. **Run locally**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## Configuration

All connection/config settings live in **db.py**. It contains placeholders‚Äîreach out to Ken Popkin for the real values.

```python
DB_HOST = "your-db-host"
DB_PORT = "5432"
DB_USER = "your-db-user"
DB_PASSWORD = "your-db-password"
DB_NAME = "your-db-name"
```

---

## Usage

- **Locally:** open `http://localhost:8501`  
- **Deployed:** use the Cloud Run URL (contact Ken Popkin for the link)

## üõ°Ô∏è Soft-Delete & Auto-Inactivation Rules

We never hard-delete rows‚Äîinstead we mark them inactive (`is_active = FALSE`) and automatically propagate that inactivation to dependent records:

1. **Teammember Inactivation**  
   When a **teammember** is set to inactive, all of their related rows in both the `assignments` and `skills_matrix` tables are also marked inactive.

2. **Role Inactivation**  
   When a **role** is set to inactive, any entries in `skills_matrix` for that role‚Äîand any rows in `assignments` where that role was assigned‚Äîare marked inactive.

3. **Product Removal**  
   When a **product** is deleted (or inactivated), all `assignments` referencing that product are marked inactive.

---

## Deployment

A simple shell script handles build & deploy:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This builds the Docker image and deploys to GCP Cloud Run under your project.

---

## Bulk-Load Routines

CSV bulk-load scripts live in the `data_to_load/` folder for:

- Products  
- Roles  
- Team Members  

Run them as needed to seed your database.
